# 📞 No Churn Telecom Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict customers who are not likely to churn (i.e., customers who will stay) in a telecom company.

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze telecom customer data and identify key features that indicate customer loyalty. This helps businesses make informed decisions to retain valuable customers.

## 📊 Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Scaling numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding feature distribution
   - Visualizing correlations and patterns

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost
   - Model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

4. **Prediction**
   - Predicting customers likely to stay (non-churn)
   - Saving the trained model for deployment

## 📂 Files in the Repository

- `telecom_customer_data.csv` – Dataset used for the project
- `churn_prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the full analysis and model
- `requirements.txt` – Python libraries required
- `churn_model.pkl` – Trained model file (optional)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Outcome

The model helps identify loyal customers with good accuracy and can be used by telecom companies to reduce churn rates by focusing on retention strategies.
